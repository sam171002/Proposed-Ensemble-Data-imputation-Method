# Proposed-Ensemble-Data-imputation-Method
I propose a novel ensemble-based imputation method that synergistically combines the strengths of KNN, IterativeImputer, mean, median, and SoftImpute. The ensemble method leverages the performance of each individual technique to provide the most accurate imputation for each missing value. We conducted extensive evaluations on a dataset with artificially introduced 2%, 5%, 10% and 20% missing data. Our results, analysed using root mean square error (RMSE), demonstrate that the proposed ensemble method consistently outperforms each individual imputation method across various levels of missing data. An ensemble approach in enhancing data quality and reliability, offering a robust solution for practitioners dealing with incomplete datasets.
